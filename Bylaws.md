## 1.0 WAIVER OF LIABILITY <a id="section-1.0"></a>

Per section 6.2 of the [Meetup.com terms of service](http://www.meetup.com/terms/) "...you agree that you bear all risk and you agree to release us (and our officers, directors, shareholders, agents, employees, affiliates, subsidiaries, and third party partners) and Organizers and Creators or Hosts and their designees from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, now and in the future..."

By joining Meetup.com and agreeing to their terms of service you understand that participation in any Meetup events, including those hosted by Fox Cities Backpackers, are at your own risk. You are responsible for your own actions and safety at all times.

## 2.0 GROUP MEMBERSHIP <a id="section-2.0"></a>

Membership in Fox Cities Backpackers is open to anyone who wishes to join. We want to encourage active and safe participation, and as such we will occasionally purge members for the following reasons:

### 2.1 REMOVAL FOR INACTIVITY <a id="section-2.1"></a>

Members may be removed for:

1.	**Non-Participation** - those who have not participated in any group event for two or more years
2.	**Non-Interaction** - those who have not visited the Fox Cities Backpackers Meetup site in more than one year

### 2.2 REMOVAL FOR CAUSE <a id="section-2.2"></a>
Additionally, a member may be permanently removed from the group for:

1.	**Conducting themselves in an unsafe manner, thereby putting themselves and/or others at risk of harm.** To do so willfully is cause for immediate removal from the group. To do so without intent, on more than one occasion and after being duly warned, is cause for immediate removal from the group.
2.	**Conducting themselves in a manner that is disruptive to the group.** To be willfully disruptive, disrespectful, or denigrate another member of the group is cause for immediate suspension from the group pending a leadership review.
3.	**Willful destruction of property.** Any willful destruction of private, public, group, or member property without express consent, whether resulting in financial or other losses or not, will be cause for immediate  suspension from the group pending a leadership review.
4.	**Willful failure to follow planned group itinerary.** To purposefully, and without notice to the event leader, deviate from the planned group itinerary in such a way as to delay or inconvenience the group as a whole is grounds for leadership review.

### 2.3 REVIEW AND REMOVAL PROCEDURES <a id="section-2.3"></a>

Leadership reviews of member misconduct may result in the group leadership issuing a warning, and may upon further violation result in the suspension or removal of offending members.

All suspensions are at the discretion of the group leader present and in charge of the event where the issue became apparent.

The group leadership will then be consulted, and by majority vote of present members of the leadership team, the offending members may continue to be suspended for a period of time or permanently removed from the group.

Any member, after being suspended from the group for a third time in any 12 month period, will automatically be permanently removed with no review.

### 2.4 CODE OF CONDUCT <a id="section-2.4"></a>

Group leadership is not here to dictate how you participate in the group. Membership is open to all types of people of any skill level or ability. We will do our best to make reasonable accommodations for members of all types. 

Beyond that we ask that group members observe the following code of conduct:

1.	**Be Safe** – Do not endanger yourself or others.
2.	**Be Responsible** – Your actions affect the group as a whole, and we want to be seen as stewards of the areas we frequent.
3.	**Be Respectful and Tolerant** – We expect all group members to treat each other with respect and tolerance, we will not accept denigration, bigotry, racism, or sexism of any type.
4.	**Be Courteous** – We have limited trip slots and resources. Do not take a spot on a trip "just in case". This is especially important for beginner trips to give members with less experience a chance to advance.

## 3.0 LEADERSHIP <a id="section-3.0"></a>

The leadership team of the Fox Cities Backpackers is made up of volunteers. None of our trip leaders receives any financial incentives to plan and execute group events, they participate because they love backpacking and they love to share their passion for the outdoors. By participating in a leadership role they are taking on a lot of responsibility and spending hours of their time for the benefit of the group. All that they ask in return is that group members respect that investment and follow the rules and guidelines laid out in this document. In exchange the leadership team will continue to do their best to help people of every skill level get outside and enjoy the sport of backpacking as often as we can!

In order to keep the group active and engaged, a leadership structure has been implemented. While somewhat informal, it is intended to provide some degree of responsibility for each position. The leadership team will attempt to lead by consensus, but in the event that a consensus cannot be reached, a simple majority will rule.

Only Assistant Organizers or Event Organizers are eligible to be nominated. Assuming the position is contested a vote will be held after the nominations have been collected, and not more than one week after the November meeting or social. Prior to the vote the member roles will be purged per section [2.1 REMOVAL FOR INACTIVITY](#section-2.1) of the group bylaws, then an email survey will be sent out to all remaining group members by a designated Assistant Organizer who is not running for either of the Organizer positions.

There can be unlimited Event Organizers.

## 4.0 TRIP SKILL RATINGS <a id="section-4.0"></a>

We have implemented trip skill ratings to prevent issues with group members attending events that they are unprepared for either with lack of appropriate gear, knowledge gaps, their mindset, or their abilities. We want members to push themselves and take on new challenges, but only if they can do so in a safe and responsible manner. We can't always prevent issues from arising, but these skill level rankings help us keep everyone safe without being overly burdensome for the Organizers.

Each trip will have a skill rank of beginner, intermediate, advanced, or will be specified as all levels.

### 4.1 REQUIREMENTS <a id="section-4.1"></a>

Each group ranking is formatted as a custom title for that group member. The format is the user's level (ie: BEGINNER, INTERMEDIATE, ADVANCED) followed by the number of trips at that level. So an intermediate level member who has completed one intermediate trip will have the title "INTERMEDIATE 1".

#### 4.1.1 BEGINNER LEVEL <a id="section-4.1.1"></a>

All members are by default BEGINNER 0 level. If you don't have a ranking you are assumed to be BEGINNER 0 level. After each beginner level trip your ranking number will increase, however you will not necessarily advance to the next level unless your trip leader feels that you meet the following guidelines:

1.	You have all the gear you need to be self sufficient
2.	You understand how to use all of your gear properly
3.	You can hike at least 10 miles in a day
4.	You can follow the trail
5.	You can understand and use a trail map

#### 4.1.2 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL <a id="section-4.1.2"></a>

All members at the intermediate level must have completed at least two beginner level trips or be able to demonstrate prior experience commensurate with this skill level (see section [4.2 DEMONSTRATED ABILITY](#section-4.2)). All members begin this skill level as INTERMEDIATE 0 level. After each intermediate level trip your ranking number will increase, however you will not necessarily advance to the next level unless your trip leader feels that you meet the following guidelines:

1. You can plan for the appropriate amount of food for a given trip length
2. You can hike at least 20 miles in a day
3. You can independently hike a given route to a designated camp site and arrive in a reasonable amount of time

#### 4.1.3 ADVANCED LEVEL <a id="section-4.1.3"></a>

All members at the advanced level must have completed at least two intermediate level trips or be able to demonstrate prior experience commensurate with this skill level (see section [4.2 DEMONSTRATED ABILITY](#section-4.2)). All members at this skill level will simply be labeled ADVANCED.

At the advanced level you should be able to demonstrate the following skills:

1.	Ability to self select trips based on ability
2.	Know your limitations

#### 4.1.4 ADVANCING <a id="section-4.1.4"></a>

Advancement to the next level is at your trip leaders discretion. We encourage trip leaders to discuss with you areas where you might need improvement before moving on to the next level. Some people make take more time to advance to the next level, or may never advance and that is ok. We welcome hikers of all different skill levels and abilities in this group.

#### 4.2 DEMONSTRATED ABILITY <a id="section-4.2"></a>

To demonstrate prior experience and get ranked you will need to contact the Organizer or an Assistant Organizer and provide one or more of the following:

1.	A trip itinerary for a trip that would meet the requirements for skill level you are seeking (see section [4.3 TRIP RANKINGS](#section-4.3))
2.	Pictures of you on the trip
3.	A gear list or pictures of your gear showing that you have all of the necessary equipment
4.	References from already ranked members of the group

Bypassing the ranking system is at the sole discretion of the Organizer or Assistant Organizer you contact. You may appeal a decision to the group Organizers, but you may not attend a ranked trip until your appeal is complete.

### 4.3 TRIP RANKINGS <a id="section-4.3"></a>

To help our Organizers to plan their trips and rank them accordingly and consistently we provide these guidelines for trip rankings. Occasionally a trip will be ranked higher or lower than these guidelines suggest based on the trip leaders discretion, however any deviation from these guidelines will be clearly spelled out in the trip description.

#### 4.3.1 BEGINNER LEVEL TRIPS <a id="section-4.3.1"></a>

All of the following must apply:

- No more than two nights
- Fairly easy and [non-technical](# "no deep snow, fast-water, ropes necessary, full-day climbs, etc...") terrain
- Less than 10 miles covered per day
- Expected temperatures to remain above 32&deg;F if camping without [permanent shelter](# "unheated cabin, adirondack shelter, or yurt") more than 0.5 miles from vehicles

- Group will never be more than 5 trail miles from a road or other "bail out" point

*Note: For a trip to count for your ranking level to increase you must cover at least 10 miles over the course of the trip*

#### 4.3.2 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL TRIPS <a id="section-4.3.2"></a>

All of the following must apply:

- No more than four nights without resupply
- Easy to challenging, and [non-technical](# "no deep snow, fast-water, ropes necessary, full-day climbs, etc...")  terrain
- Less than 20 miles covered per day
- Expected temperatures to remain above 15&deg;F if camping without [permanent shelter](# "unheated cabin, adirondack shelter, or yurt") more than 0.5 miles from vehicles
- Expected temperatures could reach below 15&deg;F if camping in a [permanent shelter](# "unheated cabin, adirondack shelter, or yurt") or camping within 0.5 miles from vehicles
- Group will never be more than 10 trail miles from a road or other "bail out" point

#### 4.3.4 ADVANCED LEVEL TRIPS <a id="section-4.3.4"></a>

If any of the following apply the trip is automatically an advanced level trip:

- Five or more nights without resupply
- Technical terrain including: deep snow, fast-water, ropes necessary, full-day climbs, etc...
- More than 30 miles covered per day
- Expected temps to reach below 15&deg;F, camping without [permanent shelter](# "unheated cabin, adirondack shelter, or yurt"), and more than 0.5 miles from vehicles
- Group to be more than 10 trail miles from a road or other "bail out" point

#### 4.3.5 COLD WEATHER NOTES <a id="section-4.3.5"></a>

For the temperature requirements, the temperature is based on average low temperature for the
location of the trip. One week (7 days) prior to the trip, the forecast will be checked and a final determination of expected temperature will be made and the final trip rating determined. If a person is no longer qualified for the trip based on the forecast, they will be issued a refund by the trip leader.

If the forecast should change by more than 10 degrees after that final determination has been made, the trip leader can make an additional change to the trip rating or cancel the trip for safety reasons, at their discretion.

## 5.0 FINANCES <a id="section-5.0"></a>

This Meetup exists simply to bring people together to do what we love. No one is doing this to make
money. The group Organizer will keep detailed records of all the club finances in the Meetup "Money" section of the group site. If any member would like to see these records at any time, simply contact the Organizer and they will be happy to share them with you.

We are investigating seeking official non-profit status but we have not yet done so. If you are an accountant or a lawyer with experience seeking non-profit status and would like to volunteer your time please contact the Organizer.

### 5.1 FEES <a id="section-5.1"></a>

While we are not for profit, we do collect fees to participate on trips to cover expenses.

#### 5.1.1 COVERED EXPENSES <a id="section-5.1.1"></a>

These fees cover:

- Any accommodations not otherwise described in the trip description as being your own
responsibility; this may include camp sites, shelters, permits, etc...
- Firewood for some trips
- Commercial shuttle services

Any excess money goes into the club reserve fund and is used for expenses such as:

- Covering the cost of maintaining the Meetup.com site
- Purchasing maps or books for planning trips
- Buying group-gear as approved by the Meetup leadership
- Financing future trips so the burden does not fall on the trip leader

#### 5.1.2 HOW ARE FEES CALCULATED <a id="section-5.1.2"></a>

We use the following formula to calculate fees:

( Trip Expenses + ( Expected Trip Members x Event Fees ) ) / Expected Trip Members

We charge a $5 per event fee that covers the costs of running the group, and is charged in lieu of an annual membership fee. It’s a pay for use system. We want to encourage new members to come to meetings and socials and get to know people and know more about backpacking before committing any money to the club.

When setting the cost of a trip, the shared costs of firewood, accommodations, transportation and such will be split based on maximum attendance for a trip. If participation doesn't meet the trip goal the group will make up the difference. This ensures that we can offer exciting trips to places that members might not be able to get to without splitting the costs.

#### 5.1.3 HOW ARE FEES COLLECTED <a id="section-5.1.3"></a>

Fees are collected through Meetup and sent to our group PayPal address. Excess funds are transferred to a group savings account where they earn interest for the group.

All trips that have either a maximum number of participants or have club costs associated with them will require pre-payment in order to RSVP for the trip. At this time we only accept payment made via the Meetup site.

#### 5.1.4 REFUNDS <a id="section-5.1.4"></a>

We only offer refunds in two circumstances:

1. Emergency - You or your immediate family experiences a health emergency that prevents you from attending the trip
2. Trip Fills Up - After you change your RSVP the trip fills back up, in this case you must request a refund within 30 days of the trip start date

#### 5.1.5 WAITING LIST <a id="section-5.1.5"></a>

Unfortunately, our options for managing a waiting list in an automated and fair manner are limited by the way Meetup works.

What we can do with the waiting list:

1. Notify people who are on the waiting list if an opening becomes available (if we see the opening, we are not notified)

What we cannot do:

1. Reserve a spot for the first person on the wait list
2. Reserve a spot for only people on the wait list
3. Prevent people not on the wait list from making an RSVP

**This means that if an opening becomes available ANYONE can RSVP for that available spot on a first come first serve basis**

## 6.0 BYLAWS <a id="section-6.0"></a>

These bylaws may be amended by the Organizers, and changes will take effect after:

1. Approval by majority vote of present members of the leadership team at an in person meeting where at least three members of the leadership team are present OR
2. Approval in an electronic format of 2/3 of the leadership team

Additionally, these bylaws may be edited for spelling or punctuation and as long as the intent does not change the updated bylaws will automatically come into effect.
